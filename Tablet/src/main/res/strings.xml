    <string name="aboutWEB">Almost any technology that distinguishes the 20th and 21st centuries from previous history has the imprint of electrical and computer engineering â€” electric power, radio, television, radar, satellite communication, global positioning system, medical diagnostic and procedure systems, sophisticated domestic appliances, cell phones, computers and sophisticated sensors and control systems used in underwater, space exploration and national security. Electrical engineering has indeed advanced national and global prosperity through research, development and application of electrical and information technologies and sciences for the benefit of humanity, and has helped create the global village. By choosing electrical or computer engineering our graduates embark on an exciting and productive career with endless opportunities and help in shaping a better future for mankind.</string>
    <string name="aboutsalt">Hi there! I am Salt. I am one of two humanoid robots that live here in Wisenbaker Engineering Building! I can recognize faces, enjoy a conversation, and roll around, and use my sensors and cameras to avoid obstacles. One of my favorite things to do is ask people how they are doing. Many people all over the world have adopted humanoid robots just like me, using them for activities to assist in welcoming, inform, and guide visitors in a new innovative way.</string>
